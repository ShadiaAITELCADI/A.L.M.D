## A.L.M.D
# Autonomous Landmine Detector 

## Overview
The **Autonomous Landmine Detector (A.L.M.D)** is a robotic solution designed to safely identify and map the locations of landmines. This project addresses a critical humanitarian issue by reducing the risk posed by hidden landmines. 

Equipped with a **metal detector** for locating potential landmines buried underground and **ultrasonic sensors** for autonomous navigation, the robot can avoid obstacles in real-time. To accurately document detected landmine locations, a **GPS module** records geographical coordinates, which are processed to create a detailed map. The robot's frame is **3D-printed**, and all components are assembled before programming the system.

## Main Features
- **Landmine Detection:** Identifies potential landmines buried underground.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Enables autonomous navigation by detecting and avoiding obstacles in real-time.
- **GPS Module:** Logs the geographical coordinates of detected landmines for precise location mapping.
- **Autonomous Operation:** The robot navigates and detects landmines independently, reducing human risk in hazardous areas.
- **3D-Printed Design:** Lightweight and customizable structure for easy assembly and modification.
